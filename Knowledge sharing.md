We have collected top 3 common/hot issues for each OSS Dev language that using Azure. The FAQ list has covered 5 OSS dev languages, i.e. Java, Python, Ruby, PHP, Node.js on Azure. Hope this collection could quickly solve or give you some quick hits about the how to resolve issues. 

- ## PHP ##
   + **Q**: What are the PHP configurations we can modify in Azure App Service Web Apps?    
     **A**: We can change the built-in PHP version from 5.4(default), 5.5, 5.6, and 7.0(preview).  
            We can change the built-in PHP_INI_USER, PHP_INI_PERDIR, PHP_INI_ALL and, PHP_INI_SYSTEM configurations.  
            We can enable extensions in the default PHP runtime.  
            We can even use a custom PHP runtime.  
            We also can enable Composer automation in Azure for manage your PHP packages.  
            For more details, please refer to the offical guide, [Configure PHP in Azure App Service Web Apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/web-sites-php-configure/).

   + **Q**: How to set up a connection to Azure SQL Database in PHP applications on Azure Web Apps?   
     **A**: Be default, the DLL libraries `php_sqlsrv` and `php_pdo_sqlsrv` have been installed in the PHP ext folder on Azure, but haven't been configured in PHP runtime. So we need to configure the extensions manually:
     1. Create a file named `.user.ini` at the root directory of your application on Azure.
     2. Write the following content in `.user.ini`:
         ```
        extension=php_pdo_sqlsrv.dll
        extension=php_sqlsrv.dll
         ```
     3. Restart your application. Check the extension of `sqlsrv` and `pdo_sqlsrv` again.

     + **Q**: How to get started with Event Hubs using Java.  
       **A**: We can get started with Event Hubs by following three steps below.
       
       1. Create an Event Hub via Azure classic portal.
       2. Send messages to Event Hubs with `EventHubClient`.
       3. Receive messages from Event Hubs with `EventProcessorHost`.
       
       The classes above `EventHubClient` & `EventProcessorHost` are in the Azure SDK for Java, you can configure the `pom.xml` file of your Maven project to reference them.
       ```XML
        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.microsoft.azure</groupId>
            <artifactId>azure-eventhubs</artifactId>
            <version>0.7.2</version>
        </dependency>
       ```

- ## Python
     + **Q**: How to create a web app in Python on Azure Web Apps.  
      **A**: Generally, you can use [Python Tools for Visual Studio](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/web-sites-python-ptvs-django-mysql/PTVS) to create a simple polls web app using one of the PTVS sample templates.  
            Then build a MySQL service hosted on Azure, and configure the web app to connect to this MySQL.  
            Then publish the web app to [Azure App Service Web Apps](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=529714) via Visual Studio.  
            Please refer to [Django and MySQL on Azure with Python Tools 2.2 for Visual Studio](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/web-sites-python-ptvs-django-mysql/) for details.

     + **Q**: How to implement Azure IOT on Raspberry Pi.  
      **A**: We suggest that you can try to extend Python with Azure IoT SDK for C, please see: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/iot-hub-device-sdk-c-intro/ and https://docs.python.org/2/extending/extending.html.

        The other choice is that using the Azure IoT SDK for NodeJS to create a server as proxy for listening Python push messages and forwarding to Azure IoTHub, please see https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdks/tree/master/node/device. And according to the version of your Respberry Pi, you need to download the suitable nodejs runtime as below from the nodejs offical website https://nodejs.org/en/download/ or via using sudo apt-get install nodejs on the Raspbian OS.  
       * Respberry Pi: ARMv6   
       * Respberry Pi 2: ARMv7  
      
       Additionally, the simple way for sending messages from device to Azure IoTHub on Respberry PI is that using the Device Messaging REST APIs in Python.

     + **Q**: AttributeError: `module` object has no attribute `BlobService`.  
       **A**: As in the latest `azure.storage 0.30.0` , `BlobSrvice` is split into `BlockBlobService`, `AppendBlobService`, `PageBlobService` object, you could use `BlockBlobService` insteading of `BlobService`. There are many articles need to update the content.  
     If you insist on perferring `BlobService`, you could install package `azure.storage 0.20.0`.

- ## Node.js
     + **Q**: How to build/deploy/configure a web app in Node.js on Azure Web Apps.  
       **A**: Please refer to [Get started with Node.js web apps in Azure App Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/app-service-web-nodejs-get-started/).  
        Additionally, Azure Web Apps uses IISNode to host the Node process inside of IIS. Your Node site is actually given a Named Pipe which receives the incoming requests, not a TCP port like you would use when running locally or hosting yourself. Even if you could open a TCP port, Azure Websites are really only meant for traditional websites and don't have a way to open ports to the outside world.

     + **Q**: How to use `tedious` to connection to Azure SQL.  
       **A**: Use following code snippet:  
        ```javascript
        var Connection = require('tedious').Connection;
        var config = {
            userName: '<yourusername>',
            password: '<yourpassword>',
            server: '<yourserver>.database.windows.net',
            // When you connect to Azure SQL Database, you need these next options.
            options: {encrypt: true, database: '<database>'}
        };
        var connection = new Connection(config);
        connection.on('connect', function(err) {
            // If no error, then good to proceed.
            console.log("Connected");
        });
        ```  
    
     - - -
     + **Q**: Azure webapp node.js app not starting  
       **A**: Azure WebApp for node.js is running via iisnode as a native IIS module that allows hosting in IIS on Windows. Please see the document https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/silverlining/2012/06/14/windows-azure-websites-node-js/ to know its features.  
        
        For debugging the webapp for node.js, I suggest you can refer to the document to know how to do it.  
        
        If you are using Visual Studio as the IDE for node.js, I recommend installing [NTVS](https://github.com/Microsoft/nodejstools) in VS for debugging and deploying the node.js. Please see the documents below to know how to get started.  
        [Installation for NTVS](https://github.com/Microsoft/nodejstools/wiki/Installation)  
        [Install Node.js and get started with NTVS](https://github.com/Microsoft/nodejstools/wiki/Install-Node.js-and-get-started-with-NTVS)  
        
        And there is an other tool called [node-inspector](https://github.com/Azure/node-inspector) for inspecting the node.js app on Azure. As reference, you can refer to the doc http://www.ranjithr.com/?p=98.  
        
        Meanwhile, please check the web.config file in your node webapp via Kudo Console, you can compare your codes with the sample generated by the template for Express from Gallery on Azure portal.
